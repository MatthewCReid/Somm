  Chardonnay: 'Chardonnay from Burgundy typically has notes of white stone fruit (like a white peach), citrus, and melon. It also usually has creamy notes as a result of malolactic fermentation. It is usually oaked, giving notes of toast and vanilla.',
  Gamay: 'French Gamay, mostly grown in Beaujolais, is a light or medium bodied wine with high acidity and low tannin. It usually has notes of red fruit (like strawberry, raspberry, and cherry), and is set apart from other fruity reds by a spicy complexity (usually cinnamon or pepper). All but the best should be consumed young, as they do not have the tannic structure to age well.',
  'Cabernet Sauvignon': 'Cabernet Sauvignon is a black grape with thick skin, meaning that the wines it produces will have high tannins, but when it\'s grown and made well, the bitter tannin is balanced by high acidity. It usually has black fruit flavors, like blackcurrant and black cherry, often accompanied by hints of bell pepper or mint, especially when it was grown in cold climates. It\'s often oaked, adding flavors of smoke, vanilla, coffee, or cedar. Because of the high tannin and acidity, Cabernet Sauvignon ages very well. It can be astringent when it is new, but mellows with age.',
